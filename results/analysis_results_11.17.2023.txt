Title: Bitcoin bull market FOMO absent as BTC price nears key $39K profit zone
Summary: The article discusses the current state of the Bitcoin market, suggesting that despite a 120% increase in BTC price this year, the anticipated "Fear Of Missing Out" (FOMO) from a bull market has not materialized. On-chain data from Look Into Bitcoin indicates that transactions are only now starting to involve bitcoins that have been held for shorter periods, implying that speculative activity is low. The Realized Cap HODL Waves metric shows that coins are beginning to move more frequently, a sign that typically accompanies bull markets. Additionally, analysis from CryptoQuant points out that most Bitcoin holders are in profit, except those who bought in the run-up to the 2021 all-time highs. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator is nearing a breakeven point for these holders, suggesting they may soon be in a profitable position if the rally continues. The article also notes that the proportion of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in loss is relatively low at 11.6%, and that whale entities have been selling BTC at current prices. The article concludes by reminding readers that it does not provide investment advice and that all investments carry risk.

Title: Native Bitcoin to be available on DeFi for the first time, details here
Summary: SushiSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX), announced its expansion to ZetaChain, a first-of-its-kind EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain that enables cross-chain swaps across 30 chains. This move will allow for native Bitcoin (BTC) trading within decentralized finance (DeFi) for the first time, eliminating the need for Bitcoin to be wrapped as ERC-20 tokens (like WBTC) for compatibility with Ethereum-based DEXes. The integration is expected to unlock Bitcoin's liquidity for DeFi and could be a significant boost for SushiSwap, which is currently ranked lower than other major DEXes. Following the announcement, SushiSwap's governance token, SUSHI, experienced a 17% price surge, although it later corrected slightly.

Title: AI's energy consumption concerns echo Bitcoin mining criticisms, says Heatbit founder
Summary: Alex Busarov, the founder of Heatbit, discussed the intersection of Bitcoin mining and AI/ML computing at the Web Summit 2023 in Lisbon. Heatbit, known for its Bitcoin-mining heaters that also serve as a heating source for homes, is exploring the potential of its devices to be used for AI training and computing resources. Busarov highlighted that while Bitcoin mining is well-understood, the compute side of AI is not as widely recognized, despite its growing demand for hardware resources. He suggested that AI computing might soon face scrutiny for its energy usage, similar to Bitcoin mining. Despite Heatbit's hardware being capable of AI and ML tasks, Busarov believes that the GPU and ASIC infrastructure will not quickly shift from cryptocurrency mining. He also sees potential for a return to home mining, driven by economic reasons, as combining mining with functions like heating could lead to zero energy costs for mining. The article also mentions the rising demand for AI computing resources and startups like io.net that are creating blockchain-powered networks for machine learning and AI computing.

Title: Bitcoin Faces Steep Correction After Failing to Break Above $38,000
Summary: Bitcoin's price struggled to surpass the $38,000 mark and has undergone a correction, currently trading at $36,251, which is a 2.51% decrease over the last 24 hours. WisdomTree has updated its application for a spot Bitcoin ETF, which is seen as a normal but essential step in the approval process with the U.S. SEC.

The market sentiment appears bearish as Bitcoin faces strong selling pressure after failing to break the $38,000 resistance, with potential further declines if it drops below the $35,240 support level.

Title: USDT Stablecoin Issuer Tether Eyes Big Move in Bitcoin Mining Market
Summary: Tether, the $87 billion stablecoin operator, is planning to enter the Bitcoin mining market with an investment of approximately $500 million over the next six months. This will include building its own mining facilities and acquiring stakes in other companies. Tether has already extended a $610 million credit facility to Northern Data AG and acquired shares in the company. The move into Bitcoin mining is a significant shift from Tether's core business, but with its financial resources, it is expected to become a formidable competitor. Tether is establishing mining facilities in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador, aiming for a 1% share of Bitcoin's total computing power. Despite the recent financial challenges in the mining industry, Tether's private status and cash generation allow it to invest heavily. Its operations are already profitable, and it plans to reach 120 megawatts by the end of 2023 and 450 megawatts by the end of 2025. Tether's facilities are designed for flexibility, with the ability to relocate if electricity costs change.
