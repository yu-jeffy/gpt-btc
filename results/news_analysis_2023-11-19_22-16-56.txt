Title: Why Bitcoin's hashrate has left the door open for bears
Summary: The article reports that Bitcoin's hashrate has hit a seven-day high, reaching 564.88 EH/s, which might indicate a potential risk for a price decline.

The current price of BTC is $36,643, but its dominance is decreasing compared to altcoins. Liquidation levels suggest a sharp decline may occur, but if the CLLD spikes, short positions could be liquidated due to a bullish reversal. The Market Cap to Thermocap ratio is currently low, indicating it could be a good time to buy for long-term holders, while short-term holders may face risks at the current price levels.

Summary: The article discusses the insights of a pseudonymous analyst, Dave the Wave, who predicted the 2021 crypto market crash and now suggests that Bitcoin (BTC) may be on the verge of a sustainable rally towards its all-time highs.

Title: Bitcoin (BTC) Sets New All-Time High
Summary: The article reports that the amount of Bitcoin held by long-term investors has reached a new all-time high, indicating a strong bullish sentiment in the market. This trend suggests that the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin remains attractive, as investors are choosing to hold their coins, potentially reducing the supply available for trading and possibly driving up the price. The behavior of these "HODLers" is seen as a measure of confidence in Bitcoin's future, and their accumulation could signal a reduction in sell pressure and the possibility of a bullish phase. However, the article also advises caution, noting that the cryptocurrency market is subject to a variety of influences, including institutional adoption, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic factors. The increase in long-term holding also reflects Bitcoin's growing recognition as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.
