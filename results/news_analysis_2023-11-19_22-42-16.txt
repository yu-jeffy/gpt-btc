Title: Crypto Expert Says Bitcoin Could Skyrocket By Over 600% Thanks To This Catalyst
Summary: James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, suggested that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC could significantly boost Bitcoin's price.

Title: Why Bitcoin's hashrate has left the door open for bears
Summary: The article discusses a recent increase in Bitcoin's hashrate to a seven-day high of 564.88 EH/s and explores the potential implications for Bitcoin's price. An on-chain analyst, Gigisulivan, suggests that this surge in hashrate could signal an impending price drop to around $31,500, drawing parallels to a similar situation from September 15th when the hashrate also peaked. The article notes that Bitcoin's price was $36,643 at the time of writing, with signs of decreasing dominance compared to altcoins. It also mentions that if the Cumulative Liq Level Delta (CLLD) spikes, short positions could be liquidated, leading to a bullish reversal. However, traders are currently favoring short positions with high leverage. The Market Cap to Thermocap ratio is discussed as an indicator of whether Bitcoin is trading at a premium or is undervalued. The current ratio suggests it might be a good time to buy. For short-term holders, the current price level is considered risky, while long-term holders may see it as an opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin at a discount.

Title: Trader Who Called 2021 Crypto Collapse Says Sustainable Bitcoin Explosion to All-Time High Technically in the Cards
Summary: The article discusses the predictions of a pseudonymous analyst, Dave the Wave, who has a history of accurately calling market movements, including the crypto crash of 2021. He suggests that Bitcoin's current price action indicates a potential rally to its all-time highs, based on his analysis using logarithmic growth channels (LGC). The bottom of these channels is considered a "buy zone" for long-term investors, and Bitcoin's price has been in this zone since it marked a bottom in late 2022. Despite daily momentum being down, the weekly momentum is up, and the MACD indicator is in bullish territory, which gives Bitcoin bulls a reason to be "quietly confident." Dave the Wave notes that Bitcoin's current price trend is more sustainable than previous rallies, as it is not exhibiting a parabolic increase like before. The article concludes with a disclaimer that it is not investment advice and encourages due diligence.

Title: Bitcoin nears pre-halving 'target zone' toward $50K BTC price
Summary: Titan of Crypto, a social media trader, has suggested that Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching a significant Fibonacci retracement level, indicating a potential top for its pre-halving rally with a target zone between $39,000 and $50,000.
