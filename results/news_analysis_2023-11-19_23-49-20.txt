Title: Potential Bitcoin Price Surge: Key Insights on a Catalyst and Projected Market Impact
Summary: James Butterfill from CoinShares has analyzed the potential impact of a U.S. SEC-approved spot Bitcoin ETF on the market. He suggests that if 10% of the $48.3 trillion in addressable U.S. assets allocated 1% to a Bitcoin ETF, it could result in a $14.4 billion inflow in the first year.

Title: Why Bitcoin's hashrate has left the door open for bears
Summary: The article reports that Bitcoin's hashrate has reached a seven-day high, which could potentially signal a price decline for BTC.
