Title: What to expect from Bitcoin and Ethereum as the bull rally ends
Summary: The article reports on the recent decline in Bitcoin's transaction volume and the end of the crypto bull rally around November 12th, as analyzed by Santiment. Bitcoin's price had surged by nearly 30% last month, but key wallets have since shed a significant amount of BTC. Despite a decrease in transaction volume and trading volume, Bitcoin's MVRV ratio and dormant token movement suggest potential for future growth. Ethereum also experienced a rally but is showing signs of a slowdown, with a drop in price and transaction volume. Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have seen their values drop as well. The overall sentiment suggests that the market may remain slow in the coming days.

Title: Potential Bitcoin Price Surge: Key Insights on a Catalyst and Projected Market Impact
Summary: James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, has analyzed the potential impact of a U.S. SEC-approved spot Bitcoin ETF on Bitcoin's price. He suggests that if 10% of the $48.3 trillion addressable U.S. assets were to invest an average of 1% into a spot Bitcoin ETF, it could result in a $14.4 billion inflow in the first year. Butterfill's model predicts that this could lead to a Bitcoin price of $141,000 per coin. If inflows reach $31.3 billion, the price could potentially surge to $265,437, marking a 627% increase from the current price of $36,475. The analysis highlights the potential for significant institutional investment and the profound effect of regulatory decisions on the cryptocurrency market, though it acknowledges the difficulty in predicting exact inflow amounts.

Title: Why Bitcoin's hashrate has left the door open for bears
Summary: The article reports that Bitcoin's hashrate has reached a seven-day high, which an analyst from CryptoQuant suggests could signal an impending price drop for BTC to around $31,500, drawing parallels to a similar situation in September. The current BTC price is $36,643, but Bitcoin's dominance is decreasing compared to altcoins. Liquidation levels indicate a potential sharp decline, and a spike in the Cumulative Liq Level Delta (CLLD) could lead to the liquidation of short positions. The Market Cap to Thermocap ratio, a metric for assessing Bitcoin's valuation, is currently low, implying it might be a good time to buy for long-term holders, while short-term holders may face risks due to the high hashrate and potential price volatility.
