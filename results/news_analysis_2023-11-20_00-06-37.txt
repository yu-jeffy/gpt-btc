Title: Potential Bitcoin Price Surge: Key Insights on a Catalyst and Projected Market Impact
Summary: James Butterfill of CoinShares suggests that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC could lead to a significant increase in Bitcoin's price due to institutional investment. He estimates that if 10% of the $48.3 trillion addressable assets in the U.S. were to invest an average of 1% into a Bitcoin ETF, it could result in an inflow of $14.4 billion in the first year. Butterfill's model correlates these potential inflows with a substantial increase in Bitcoin's price, suggesting a rise to $141,000 per Bitcoin with a $14.4 billion inflow, and up to $265,437 with a $31.3 billion inflow, which represents a 627% increase from the current price of $36,475. However, he acknowledges the difficulty in predicting the exact inflows and subsequent price changes.

Title: Bitcoin nears pre-halving 'target zone' toward $50K BTC price
Summary: Titan of Crypto, a social media trader, has suggested that Bitcoin (BTC) is nearing a key Fibonacci retracement level, potentially marking the top of its pre-halving rally with a target zone between $39,000 and $50,000.

Other analysts, such as Filbfilb from DecenTrader, also anticipate a rise to around $46,000, although a price dip is not ruled out. Post-halving predictions are even more bullish, with some forecasts exceeding $130,000 by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, a potential immediate downside is identified at $30,900, which could be a healthy correction within Bitcoin's market uptrends. Currently, BTC is trading at $36,500, having moved sideways over the recent weekend.

Summary: The article reports that the amount of Bitcoin held by long-term investors has reached a new all-time high, indicating a bullish sentiment in the market despite the volatility experienced throughout the year. This trend of increased holding suggests that Bitcoin's long-term value proposition is still attractive, and it could lead to a decrease in supply on the market, potentially driving prices up.

Nevertheless, the article advises caution, noting that the cryptocurrency market is affected by various factors, including institutional adoption, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic conditions.
