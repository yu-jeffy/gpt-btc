Title: What to expect from Bitcoin and Ethereum as the bull rally ends
Summary: The article discusses the recent decline in Bitcoin's transaction volume and the end of the crypto market's bull rally, which saw significant gains in recent weeks. Bitcoin's price surged by nearly 30% last month, but wallets holding between 10 – 10k BTC have shed a substantial number of bitcoins, and key metrics like transaction volume and MVRV ratio suggest a potential slowdown. Bitcoin was trading at $36,656.75 with a market cap of over $716 billion at the time of writing, and its trading volume had decreased by 40%. The fear and greed index indicated 'greed,' which could signal a price drop. Technical analysis showed bearish signs with a bearish MACD crossover and a downtick in RSI. Ethereum also experienced a rally, but its price has since dropped by over 4%, and selling sentiment appears dominant. Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have also seen price declines. The overall market outlook suggests a potential period of slower activity ahead.

Title: Potential Bitcoin Price Surge: Key Insights on a Catalyst and Projected Market Impact
Summary: James Butterfill of CoinShares has analyzed the potential impact of a U.S. SEC-approved spot Bitcoin ETF on Bitcoin's price. He suggests that if 10% of the $48.3 trillion addressable assets in the U.S. were to allocate an average of 1% to a Bitcoin ETF, it could result in a $14.4 billion inflow in the first year. His model indicates that this could drive Bitcoin's price to $141,000 per coin, and if inflows reach $31.3 billion, the price could surge to $265,437, which is a 627% increase from its current price of $36,475. Butterfill highlights the correlation between inflows as a percentage of AUM and Bitcoin's price change, emphasizing the potential for significant market impact if a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved.

Summary: The article provides a technical and on-chain analysis of Bitcoin's price movements. Bitcoin encountered resistance at $37K and entered a consolidation phase between $37K and $35K.
