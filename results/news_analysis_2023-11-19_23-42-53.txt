Title: What to expect from Bitcoin and Ethereum as the bull rally ends
Summary: The article discusses the end of the recent bull rally in the cryptocurrency market, with a focus on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Bitcoin's transaction volume has declined, despite its price surging by nearly 30% last month. Key Bitcoin wallets have reduced their holdings, and the MVRV ratio suggests that trading returns need to even out. Bitcoin's price has decreased over the past week, and trading volume has dropped significantly, indicating less investor activity. The fear and greed index is in a 'greed' state, which could signal a potential price drop. Technical indicators like the MACD and RSI on Bitcoin's daily chart show bearish signs, while the Bollinger Bands indicate less volatility. Ethereum also experienced a price increase during the rally but has since seen a decline. Ethereum's transaction volume and number of transactions have decreased, but there is increased demand in the derivatives market. Meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have also seen price drops. The overall sentiment is that the crypto market may slow down in the coming days.
